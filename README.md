# MLB Player of the Week Voting Web App



Welcome to the MLB Player of the Week Voting web application! This application allows users to vote for their favorite Major League Baseball (MLB) player of the week. The project is built using Tailwind CSS and Svelte, ensuring a seamless and reactive design for a great user experience.


Originally designed to plug into a backend, I created this branch to show off entirely with the front end. JSONs are hard coded and stored in the file.

## Demo
